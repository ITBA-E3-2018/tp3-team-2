\section{\color{olive}Excercise 2: State Machines to Detect the sequence 1-1-0-1}
In this exercise, the detection of the sequence 1-1-0-1 inside a longer sequence of bits, is done with a Moore's state machine and with a Mealy's state machine. The main difference between these two state machines is that in Moore's one, the output only depends on the present state of the machine, while in Mealy's one, the output depends on the present state as well as on the input.
