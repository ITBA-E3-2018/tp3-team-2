For this exercise we were asked to implement the Moore machine shown
on Figure \ref{3_1}, but with one condition, everything inside our
machine should work on 3.3v and inputs and outputs should work on
5v logic.

\subsection{\color{purple}State Machine Implementation}

We proceeded to convert the diagram to a table that represents it,
and we got Table \ref{3_t_1}, and by transforming each bit (Output,
and next states bits) into a truth table, we could create our logic
implementation for each bit. The Truth Tables are shown on Tables
\ref{3_t_2}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
State & W=0 & W=1 & Output\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
00 & 00 & 01 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
01 & 00 & 10 & 1\tabularnewline
\hline 
10 & 00 & 10 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Moore Machine Table}
\label{3_t_1}

\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline 
S1 S0 & Output\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
00 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
01 & 1\tabularnewline
\hline 
10 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
11 & x\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular} ~%
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
S1 & S0 & W & S1' & S0'\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\tabularnewline
\hline 
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
1 & 1 & 0 & x & x\tabularnewline
\hline 
1 & 1 & 1 & x & x\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Truth Tables}
\label{3_t_2}

\end{table}

So by re-writing those truth tables we have got the following equations:

\begin{equation}
Output=S_{1}\,.\,\bar{S_{0}}\label{eq:3_1}
\end{equation}

\[
S_{1}^{'}=\bar{S_{1}}S_{0}w+S_{1}\bar{S_{0}}w
\]

\[
S_{0}^{'}=\bar{S_{1}}\bar{S_{0}}w
\]

So, by implementing those formulas into a synchronized logic circuit,
we have got the Moore machine.

\subsection{\color{purple}Level Converter Implementation}

To convert the voltage levels on the PCB for compatibility, we decided
to use 2N7000 Mosfet Transistor. We used it to implement an inverter
with Open-Collector. By connecting the output to a pull-up network
with the voltage we want, we can convert the level with no problems,
form 5(v) to 3.3(v), and vice versa.

For the Pull-Up network, we decided to use a resistor $R=1\,(k\Omega)$
so that when it's conected to ground, te current flowing through the
inverter is less than $10\,(mA)$, and when the inverter produces
a High Z, the resistor its not enough big to produce a High Z to the
output, and set the output to a logic 1.

\subsection{\color{purple}PCB Implementation}

We proceeded to implement the PCB using Altium Designer, the Schematic
for this Finite State Machine is shown on Figure \ref{3_2}. The Top
and Bottom Layers are shown on Figure \ref{3_3}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{\color{purple}Mealy State Machine Re-Implementation}

Finally, we were asked to re-implement the Moore State machine described
in the previous Subsections, into a Mealy State Machine. As we know,
Mealy Machines Outputs depend on states and inputs, different from
Moore that only depends on states. So the truth tables for the next
state, mantains its form and formula as the moore state machine, however,
the output truth table, and by consequence, its formula , change ash
shown on Table \ref{3_t_3}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
State & W=0 & W=1\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
00 & 00/0 & 01/1\tabularnewline
\hline 
01 & 00/0 & 10/0\tabularnewline
\hline 
10 & 00/0 & 10/0\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Mealy State Machine}
\label{3_t_4}
\end{table}

We can now easily see that in Table \ref{3_t_4}, states 01 and 10
are equal, so we can simplify those states into only one state. The
final Table is shown on Table \ref{3_t_5}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
State & W=0 & W=1\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
0 & 0/0 & 1/1\tabularnewline
\hline 
1 & 0/0 & 1/0\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Mealy Machine simplified}

\label{3_t_5}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
State & W & Output\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
0 & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
0 & 1 & 1\tabularnewline
\hline 
1 & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
1 & 1 & 0\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Output Truth Table}

\label{3_t_3}
\end{table}

Finally, the formulas for the output and the next states are the following:

\[
Output=\bar{St}.W
\]

\[
State=W
\]

Implementing this would become someting like shown on Figure \ref{3_4}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../Exercise3/Assignment/images/Schematic2}

\end{figure}

We builded this schematic in a breadboard, as shon on Figure \ref{3_5}.

\subsection{\color{purple}Conclusions}

By analizing the behaviour of both circuits, how they behave in the
same test conditions, and comparing the amount of components used
in both PCBs, we conclude that in this case, Mealy's implementation
is more efficient because it utilizes less components and realizes
the same operation. However, we need to clarify that not always Mealy's
implementation is more efficient than Moore's, this depends on each
state machine to implement.
