\section{Moore's Finite State Machine}

Moore's Finite State Machine (FSM) follows a model where the next state of the machine is determined by the current
inputs and its current state, while the output is determined by the current state of the machine, following the
designed combinational logic.

\subsection{Design}

Given the specifications required of the pump controller, the functionality of the fsm was represented
on Figure \ref{fig:moore_flow} and on Table \ref{fig:moore_table}, where "LnA" stands for "Last not Activated".
